# VSCode-Template
VSCode template life saver, cause you have to make EVERYTHING yourself on VSCode...
This includes MakeFile, Json's, etc, just change it up a bit, libs, etc to make it work for you projects

src = your .c or .cpp files
include = .h files

if you dont know how to use it, ctrl + shift + p, and select your task build, or debugging, performance mode debug or normal debug

more info, if you have MingW, easiest way how to make it work, put it in C drive, and then go to windows environment and add path C:\mingw64\bin

$${\color{red}*Theres is another repository of mine where i include Clang Formating Portable folder 400mb
so no need to download bloated LLVM if not needed...
just need to add it in windows environment path*}$$
