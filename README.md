# VSCode-Template
VSCode template life saver, cause you have to make EVERYTHING yourself on VSCode...
This includes MakeFile, Json's, etc, just change it up a bit, libs, etc to make it work for you projects

src = your .c or .cpp files,   
include = .h files

if you dont know how to use it, ctrl + shift + p, and select your task build, or debugging, performance mode debug or normal debug

more info, if you have MinGW, and you should, its the best lol, easiest way how to make it work, put it in C drive, and then go to windows environment and add path C:\mingw64\bin
idk how on linux tho

> ⚠️ **Note:** *There is another repository of mine where I include a Clang Formatting Portable folder (200 MB),  
so Clang file would work in VSCode, it formatas code with advanced settings, if you need it, no need to instal bloated LLVM if not needed...  
just add it to the Windows environment path.*
